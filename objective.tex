This part should be short. Talk about modeling the optimization problem, with dynamics as the constraints. 

Then, discuss the extensibility of the formulation to other problems

\begin{itemize}
    \item State estimation
    \item Variable Speed limits
    \item Rerouting (probably cite some of my previous work)
\end{itemize}
