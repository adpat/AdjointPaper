\label{sub:network_model}

% go over the sequential links, onramp, offramp assumptions.

% introduce in a continuous fashion, starting with PDE work to show that it's a rigorous reduction from PDE stuff.

We model a freeway stretch as a sequence of junctions $\junctions=\seq{\jn}{\jnidx},\jnidx=\left[0,\ldots,\nlinks -1\right]$.
Furthermore, each junction $\jn_{\jnidx}$ has an onramp with 
a maximum out flux $\rampMax_{\jnidx}$
and a merging priority $\priority_{\jnidx}$, and an offramp with
a throughput split ratio $\splitRatio_{\jnidx}$\footnote{The network parameters can all be time-dependent in the general case, but are presented as constant for simplicity.}. Connecting junctions $\jn_{\jnidx}$ and $\jn_{\jnidx+1}$ is road link $\link_{\jnidx}\in\links$, which has length $\length_\jnidx$, and the triangular fundamental diagram parameters:
free-flow speed $\vfd_{\jnidx}$, 
congestion wave speed $\wfd_{\jnidx}$, 
critical density $\pcfd_{\jnidx}$, 
max density $\pmfd_{\jnidx}$, and
max flux $\fmfd_{\jnidx}$. Figure~\ref{fig:freeway-network} summarizes the network topology and parameters.

\subsection{Dynamics} % (fold)
\label{sub:dynamics}

Since we wish to have numerical stability in our model dynamics, we use a macroscopic traffic-flow model, derived from partial differential equations.
We use a first-order LWR \cite{lighthill1955kinematic,richards1956shock} network model developed in~\cite{Monache2013}, which is particularly suitable for freeway control and can be seen as an extension of the model in~\cite{garavello2006traffic}. The model in~\cite{Monache2013} is employed for its strong boundary conditions on the onramps to ensure all flux demand passes through the network~\cite{strub2006weak} and ability to accurately model $2\times2$ junctions without blocking onramp flux.

In order to simulate the model or use it within an optimization framework, we first discretize the model using the Godunov scheme~\cite{godunov1959}, as detailed in~\cite{Monache2013}. The initial conditions of the model are set by specifying an initial density $\po$ (vehicles per unit length) for all links and an initial queue length $\lo$ (vehicles) for all onramps. The boundary conditions are specified as ramp flux demands $\rampBC$ for all ramps and all time steps, noting that the upstream mainline source is modeled as an onramp.

The system of equations for the discretized system is given in Equation~\eqref{eqn:system-of-equations}, for a given link $i \in \left[0,\ldots,\horizon\right]$ and time step $k \in \left[0,\ldots,\horizon\right]$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn:system-of-equations}
% density
\idx{\density}{i}{k} & = & 
\idx{\density}{i}{k-1} + \frac{\dt}{\length_i} \left(\idx{\fIn}{i}{k-1} - \idx{\fOut}{i}{k-1}\right)
\\
% queue
\idx{\queue}{i}{k} & = & 
\idx{\queue}{i}{k-1} + \dt \left(\idx{\rampBC}{i}{k-1} - \idx{\fRamp}{i}{k-1}\right) \\
% demand
\idx{\demand}{i}{k} & = & 
\min\left( \fmfd_i, \vfd_i \idx{\density}{i}{k} \right)
\\
% supply
\idx{\supply}{i}{k} & = & 
\min\left(\fmfd_i, \wfd \left( \pmfd_i - \idx{\density}{i}{k} \right)\right)
\\
% ramp demand
\footnotemark
\idx{\rampDemand}{i}{k} & = & 
\min\left( \rampMax_i, \idx{\queue}{i}{k} / \dt \right)
\\
% flux in
\idx{\fIn}{i}{k} & = & 
\min\left( \splitRatio_{i-1} \idx{\demand}{i-1}{k} + \idx{\rampDemand}{i}{k}, \idx{\supply}{i}{k} \right)
\\
% flux out
\idx{\fOut}{i}{k} & = &
\begin{cases}
% case 1
\idx{\demand}{i}{k} & 
\frac{\idx{\supply}{i+1}{k}\priority_{i+1}}{1 + \priority_{i+1}} \ge \idx{\demand}{i}{k}\splitRatio_{i+1}{k} \\
% case 2
\left(\idx{\fIn}{i+1}{k} - \idx{\rampDemand}{i_1}{k}\right) / \splitRatio_{i +1} & 
\frac{\idx{\supply}{i+1}{k}}{1 + \priority_{i+1}} \ge \idx{\rampDemand}{i}{k} \\
% case 3
\frac{\idx{\supply}{i+1}{k}\priority_{i+1}}{\left(1 + \priority_{i+1}\right)\splitRatio_{i+1}{k}} &
\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\\
% ramp flux
\idx{\fRamp}{i}{k} & = & 
\idx{\fIn}{i}{k} - \splitRatio_{i} \idx{\fOut}{i-1}{k}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\footnotetext{This is a simplification of~\cite{Monache2013} for the case when the ramp empties on a time step, with minimal effect on numerical results.}

The intermediate variables (those used to calculate the states variables, $\density$ and $\queue$) represent the following values; $\demand$, the demand, is the amount of flux that a link can send downstream in a time step; $\supply$, the supply, is the amount of flux that a link can receive; $\rampDemand$, the ramp demand, is the amount of flux that an onramp can send; $\fIn/\fOut$ is the flux that enters/exits upstream/downstream of a link; $\fRamp$ is the flux that exits an onramp.

By taking the system in Equation~\eqref{eqn:system-of-equations},the initial and boundary conditions, and subtracting the right hand side of each equation in the system, then we can construct the system $\sysMat \left( \state \right) = 0$, where $x$ is the entire state vector, ordered first by time step, then by variable type (e.g. $\density, \queue, \demand,$ etc), and finally by link. More details about the ordering and its effect on the efficiency of gradient computation is given in Section~\ref{sub:efficient_solution_of_system_via_depth_first_search_system_solution}. The system of equations can be solved in linear time via forward-substitution, similar to other first-order network models such as the cell transmission model~\cite{daganzo1995cell}.
