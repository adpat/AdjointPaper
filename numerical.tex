An array of issues that must be considered for this particular problem

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given affine nature, control parameter must always be `pushed back` into the active region
    \item Projection must be done to account for geometric constraints in adjoint. For our case, we must take care to assure non-zero control parameters
    \item Barrier functions effective, but introduce tuning parameters, but more robust than projections.
    \item Non-linear solvers can also be used which can take advantage of gradient information.
    \item Maybe look into what BFGS can handle. If we use bfgs, compare time that it takes to time to compute gradient of $u$.
\end{itemize}
