Evaluation of running time:

show that it can scale linearly with the size of the network. Also, give indication what size networks and time horizons are possible for real-time use in MPC applications.

comparison with similar methods:

This part will have to show under what circumstances our method is better. Which in my mind is the accurate representation of the dynamics and when the predictive nature is beneficial. Need to understand when shortsightedness is harmful, for the HERO case.
