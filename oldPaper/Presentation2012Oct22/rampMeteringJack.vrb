\begin{itemize}
\item If the solution at time $t_0$ lies on a limiting side then the solution at time $t_0+$ will lie there too.
\vspace*{3mm}
\item The limiting side does not change.\\ At time $t_0+$ the non limiting side can only increase while the limiting side's feasible set remains the same.
\end{itemize}
