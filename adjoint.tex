\subsection{Solving for gradient in deterministic systems} % (fold)
\label{sub:solving_for_gradient_in_deterministic_systems}

go through the usually paces of taking derivatives and applying the chain rule: crib from Alex's air traffic paper a bit here

% subsection solving_for_gradient_in_deterministic_systems (end)

\subsection{Adjoint system} % (fold)
\label{sub:adjoint_system}

go through the transformation, and talk about efficiencies

\begin{itemize}
    \item solve system for vector rather than matrix, gain in efficiencies
    \item information on senstivity reported from adjoint vector
\end{itemize}

% subsection adjoint_system (end)

\jdrcomment{can probably put the full derivation in an appendix of some sort, really dry}

\subsection{Constructing triangular system} % (fold)
\label{sub:constructing_triangular_system}

Show the one figure which shows the topological dependencies of the variables, based on forward sim analysis.

% subsection constructing_triangular_system (end)

\subsection{Efficient solution of system via depth-first-search system solution} % (fold)
\label{sub:efficient_solution_of_system_via_depth_first_search_system_solution}

by doing some graph theory on the $\dhdx$ matrix, then you can get really efficient solutions, which take advantage of sparsity.

The running time of the system solution is then $O\left(k\right)$, where $k$ is the number of non-zero elements.
